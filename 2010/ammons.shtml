I can not imagine any topic more compellingand any time more appropriate than for Widener to facilitate a discussion about the meaning and significance of the Constitution on Constitution Day.  Please take advantage of this resource by reading the <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/constitution/2010/essays.shtml" title="Essays">essay collection</a> and <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/constitution/2010/participate.shtml" title="participate">submitting your own comments</a>.</p><p>I would like to thank all of the authors who contributed essays to this website.  We are grateful that they found time in their busyschedules to share their thoughts about the Constitution's role in our society.  I also want to thank Professor Alan E. Garfield, our H. Albert Young Fellow in Constitutional Law, who conceived of and organized this project; Cassandra King, our webmaster, for designing the website; and Mary Allen, our public relations specialist, for publicizing the website. </p><p>Linda L.
