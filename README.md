DelawareConstitutionSites
=========================

Every year, Widener Law launches a site commemorating September 17, Constitution Day. The 2006-2010 sites were built using .shtml files. Beginning in 2011, I switched to using WordPress for creating the sites.

UPDATE

You can see screenshots of each year's theme and site:

Notes:
--------------------
Although these are older sites, I have put them here   to show some older .shtml projects. Most of my current projects are built on WordPress. You can see [my portfolio here] (http://www.workandplay.net)
