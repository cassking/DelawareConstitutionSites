<p>This site was created to give members of the "First State" - and our friends in other states - an opportunity to collectively celebrate Constitution Day.  
This new national observance is marked each year on September 17, the date the Constitution was signed in Philadelphia in 1787.  Delaware, the first state to
ratify the Constitution, hopes to once again take the lead by setting an example for how a state can meaningfully celebrate Constitution Day.</p>

<p>But what should we celebrate about the Constitution?  Why, after all, is the Constitution so important for Americans?  What values does it embody?  
And what role does each of us have in ensuring that the Constitution remains vibrant?</p>

<p>This website provides a forum for us to consider these questions.  This year, and hopefully for many more to come, it will be a place where we can 
reflect upon the ties that bind us together, and the responsibilities that each of us has to ensure that our ambitious experiment in self-governance continues to flourish.</p>
